## Instructions
Download the latest release (v1.0.2) [here](https://github.com/nrcrast/DbdPerkTool/releases/download/v1.0.2/Dead.By.Daylight.Icon.Toolbox.Setup.1.0.2.exe).

## Why is Windows complaining?
The license to sign a Windows desktop application costs $400 a year. If the community is willing to front the money, I'll pay for it. Otherwise I've made the repo open source so you can be sure I'm not up to any funny business.
